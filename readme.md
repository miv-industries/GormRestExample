 Go rest Toy app built with Gorm and Fiber

  - Install [air](https://github.com/cosmtrek/air)
  - Run ```alias air='$(go env GOPATH)/bin/air'```
  - You can now run ```air``` in the project directory to start the hot-reload server. It will rebuild on change
  - You should pop the postman collection I gave you right in so you don't have to worry about writing requests


Roadmap
